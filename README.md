## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:
20 because my code works, and also a few extra because I added a refresh button, one of the extra credit options.

## Self-Reflection:
This was an interesting lab! Most of the battle in figuring out how to code this properly was figuring out what the instructions were telling me what to do. For the longest time I was confused out multiple methods of the same method being shown on the instrustions, until I figured out that was to show why we were changing it to async. Also, since he gave us a lot of code, some of figuring out what to do was realizing that I didn't have to code the loop, he had already given it to us. 

### How long it took me to finish this?
Around 5 hours.
